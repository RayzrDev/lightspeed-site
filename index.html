					<h3>Vanilla Gameplay</h3>
					<p>We believe that Minecraft is best enjoyed when experienced as it was originally intended, so LightspeedMC was designed
						to have a nearly vanilla experience, with only a few minor enhancements to keep things interesting.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="split">
					<h3>Friendly Community</h3>
					<p>Nobody likes a bully or a griefer! That's why the LightspeedMC staff make sure to keep things under control so that
						our members can enjoy a friendly, inviting environment where they will want to stay.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="split">
					<h3>24/7 Uptime</h3>
					<p>LightspeedMC is a 24/7 server, meaning you can join at any time! Feel like hopping on with your friends at 3 AM for
						a late night gaming session? Go for it! We look forward to seeing you.</p>
